Object-Oriented C++ Programming

Hello everyone, I’m Tejasvi. I am currently pursuing Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca Polytechnic.  
This repository contains my workshop assignments completed while learning **object-oriented programming concepts using C++**.

The code in this repository focuses on applying core OOP principles such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and modular design. Each assignment demonstrates structured coding practices and real-world problem-solving using C++.

Thank you, and happy learning!
